[45]  "There was a time long ago when Elves wandered the world in great numbers, when their achievements outshone even "
      "the brightness of the sun, when human and Dwarven civilizations were still in their infancies. There was a time "
      "of legends and heroes, of incredible accomplishments and great deeds, a time when the world knew true grandeur. "
      "That time is long gone, however, crushed under the heel of fate and decay. The Elves are gone, now, victims to "
      "their own delusions. They failed to heed the warnings of the Harbinger, the one who came to warn them. He "
      "arrived on the night the moons and the Centaur constellation were aligned, several millenia ago, his appearance "
      "foul and nightmarish, and warned all who would listen of the impending doom that lay ahead. He issued warnings "
      "and prophecies, but the Elves had grown vain and arrogant, and heeded him not. The Harbinger left, promising to "
      "return when the time would be right again."
[46]  "Several generations later -- a long time by human reckoning -- the Harbinger returned, once more treading under "
      "an alignment of the moons and constellations. The Elves had all but forgotten his past warnings. As the Curse "
      "fell upon their race, they stood defenseless. Despite their arcane lore and magical skills, they could not "
      "resist the godly powers that crushed them. When the Harbinger left their lands, there was not a single building "
      "standing. It is said that the winds carried the stench of death even as far as the Dwarven villages to the north. "
      "The latter took this for a sign that evil was coming, and prepared to defend themselves. When the Harbinger came "
      "to their lands to warn them too that their turn would come, that great danger lay ahead, they grew fearful of the "
      "visitor's appearance, and shunned him. He left them, warning them that achievements alone were not the measure of "
      "a worthy people."
[47]  "A millenia later, the skies repeated their fateful alignment of moons and stars. The Dwarves had flourished into a "
      "society of craftsmen and artisans. They had built great cities and were dutifully worshipping their god. Prophecies "
      "from long ago warned them against a fate similar to that of the Elves, so they had taken care to properly groom "
      "themselves and prepare for the Third Coming. When the Harbinger came to them, however, they could not stand the "
      "sight and smell of him, and, mistaking him for some fiend from hell, immediately struck him down. This, historians "
      "say, was the very act that caused the downfall of the Dwarves. They also say that some humans witnessed the event, "
      "and that the Harbinger warned them as well, that he told them they too would be judged, lest their worthiness be "
      "greater than that of the Elves and the Dwarves. "
